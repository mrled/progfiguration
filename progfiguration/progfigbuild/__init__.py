            it won't work if you're running progfiguration itself from a zipapp for some reason.
        compression: The compression level to use for the zipapp file.
            This can be zipfile.ZIP_STORED (no compression) or zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED (deflate compression).
            ZIP_STORED (the default) is faster.

    Returns:
        The path to the zipapp file, eg "/path/to/my_progfigsite.pyz"

    What this function does:

    * Zip up the contents of the site package.
    * Place them inside a subdirectory called 'progfigsite'.
    * Add a __main__.py file to the root of the zip file.
    * Add the progfiguration package to the zip file.
    * Add a shebang to the beginning of the zip file.

    Inspired by the zipapp module code
    <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.11/Lib/zipapp.py>

    We don't use the zipapp code itself because we want more control over what goes into the zipfile,
    like ignoring __pycache__, *.dist-info, etc.

    We don't need the ProgfigsitePythonPackagePreparer context manager here,
    because we don't need to inject build data into the filesystem before building the zipapp.
    We can inject the build data directly into the zipapp file.

    Preparation consists of finding the project path from the package path

    like a version from progfigsite's `mint_version()` and the build date.
    When the context manager exits, the injected files are removed.

    You can use this to build a pip package with build and setuptools like this:

    ```python
    with ProgfigsitePythonPackagePreparer("/path/to/progfigsite") as preparer:
        result = subprocess.run(

    ```

    See the implementation of `build_progfigsite_pip()` for a more complete example.

    If you want to modify the build in some way,
    or build another kind of package after we prepare the filesystem and inject build data,
    you can do that instead.

    Can be used by progfigsite to do something with the result of `python -m build`,
    like build a package for another package manager.
