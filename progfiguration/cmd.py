    Params:

    * `cmd`: The command to run. If a string, it will be passed to a shell.
    * `print_output`: Print the command's stdout/stderr in to the controlling terminal's stdout/stderr in real time.
        stdout/stderr is always captured and returned, whether this is True or False (superpowers).
        The .stdout and .stderr properties are always strings, not bytes
        (which is required because we must use universal_newlines=True).
        * <https://gist.github.com/nawatts/e2cdca610463200c12eac2a14efc0bfb>
        * <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4417546/constantly-print-subprocess-output-while-process-is-running>
    * `log_output`: Log the command's stdout/stderr in a single log message (each) after the command completes.
    * `check`: Raise an exception if the command returns a non-zero exit code.
        Unlike subprocess.run, this is True by default.
    * `*args, **kwargs`: Passed to subprocess.Popen
        Do not pass the following arguments, as they are used internally:
        * shell: Determined automatically based on the type of cmd
        * stdout: Always subprocess.PIPE
        * stderr: Always subprocess.PIPE
        * universal_newlines: Always True
        * bufsize: Always 1

    A `MagicPopen` object is always returned.
