# NNSS

Lovingly named after the [Nevada National Security Site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Test_Site).

This is a progfigsite we use for testing.
It shouldn't be a subpack of any other package,
which means this directory should not have an `__init__.py` in it.

**DO NOT USE THE `controller.age` FILE IN THIS DIRECTORY.**
It is committed to have something to test against.
The secret key is public!
