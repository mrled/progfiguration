Lobotomization
==============

Progfiguration was originally written as a Python package to manage one set of infrastructure (mine).
During the lobotomization process,
we split its brain into two:

1. core progfiguration, containing generic code that anyone can use, and
2. site progfiguration, which is different for each site

For those familiar with other config management systems,
the Ansible project is to a given organization's ansible repository as core progfiguration is to site progfiguration.

TODO: Link to pre- and post- lobotomization git commits for context.
