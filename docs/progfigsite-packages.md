# progfigsite packages

Progfigsite packages are packages that define an inventory,
with nodes, groups, roles, and functions,
and depend on progfiguration core to apply them.

## progfigsite API

Site packages must meet the following requirements:

- Submodules:
  - Required:
    - `nodes`
    - `roles`
    - `groups`
    - `builddata`: should contain only an empty `__init__.py` file and nothing else
    Optional:
    - `sitelib`: not used by progfiguration, but can be used internally in the site package
- Data files:
  - Required:
    - `inventory.conf`
- Variables exported from package root:
  - Required:
    - `site_name`: An arbitrary string used to identify the site to users
    - `mint_version()`: A function that returns a valid pip version number
    - `get_version()`: A function that returns the injected version or falls back to a default
  - Optional:
    - `site_description`: A longer string describing the site

Other names are reserved for future use by progfiguration.

## Vendoring and dependencies

Progfigsite packages reference progfiguration core modules.
By default, when deployed, they include progfiguration core so that they are self-contained.
You can also build progfigsite packages without a vendored progfiguration core.

Progfiguration has no runtime dependencies,
but progfigsite packages may depend on third party libraries if you choose.
These can be vendored as well.

(Progfiguration and progfigsite both have build-time dependencies when building pip packages.
Building zipapp packages can be done entirely without dependencies.)

The design is intended to give maximum flexibility to progfigisite users.

## Installing packages

Progfiguration core can be installed on its own and used to bootstrap a progfigsite.
You can install it standalone with one of:

* pip from pypi:
  `pip install progfiguration`
* pip from a local checkout of the repository:
  `git checkout https://github.com/mrled/progfiguration; cd progfiguration; pip install -e .`

Both of these methods work like this under the hood:

  * progfiguration finds progfigsite via `progfigsite` in Python path,
    or via `--progfigsite-package-path` command-line argument

Progfigsites can be installed for local development with:

* pip from a local checkout:
  `git checkout https://example.com/progfigsite.git; cd progfigsite; pip install -e .`
    * progfigsite `pyproject.toml` AND progfiguration `pyproject.toml`,
    * Commands from both, which must not conflict
    * progfigsite finds `progfiguration` package in Python path, installed directly by pip
    * progfiguration finds `progfigsite` package in Python path, installed directly by pip

You can install and run a combined progfiguration core + progfigsite package with one of:

* zipapp deployment from a package built with `progfiguration build pyz`,
  which just requires copying the `progfiguration.pyz` file and running it
    * progfiguration `pyproject.toml` only
    * commands from `progfiguration_cmd`
    * progfigsite finds `progfiguration` package in Python path which includes root of zipapp
    * progfiguration finds `progfigsite` package in Python path which includes root of zipapp
* a pip package built with `progfiguration build pip`:
  `pip install /path/to/progfigsite-x.y.z.tar.gz`
    * progfigsite `pyproject.toml` only
    * commands from both (must not conflict)
    * progfigsite finds `progfiguration` package in `autovendor` directory because of `ensure_autovendor()`
    * progfiguration finds `progfigsite` package in Python path because progfigsite was installed by pip

## Building pacakges

Progfigsite packages can be in _whatever format you want_.
If your hosts are RHEL, you might build RPMs.
The original hosts that progfiguration was written for were Alpine Linux, and consumed APKs.
Your own site might use something else,
and it can define instructions for building packages in whatever format you need.

Progfiguration core does support building two package types itself:
pip packages, and zipapp packages.

### pip packages

TODO: pip packages not actually supported yet

Pip itself needs no introduction.
We keep the ability to build pip packages in progfiguration core,
rather than delegating it to progfigsite implementations,
for two reasons:

1.  It's universal.
    Any Python that can run progfiguration at all can install a progfigsite package via pip,
    including into a venv.
2.  It's the easiest way to build distribution-specific packages.
    RPMs can be built from Python build instructions,
    and so can APKs.

### zipapp packages

zipapp is a [feature of the Python standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipapp.html),
but it's less well-known.
In short, you can zip up any Python module and add a small `__main__.py`
and execute it with the default Python interpreter just as if it were a Python script written in UTF-8.
This method allows embedding dependencies as well.
All code executed this way must be pure Python code (no C extensions).
We use zipapp because:

1.  Building a zipapp package is _extremely_ fast
2.  It's deployable instantly to anywhere with a Python interpreter

You can build progfigsite packages with these two methods via `progfiguration build`,
and see the code in the `progfiguration.progfigbuild` package.
